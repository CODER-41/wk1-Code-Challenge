## Description
This code challenge comprises three solved code challenges, which were  completed using JavaScript as my programming language. Let's dive into problem one of our week one code challenge.

part1: studentsGrade generator
This is a JavaScript program written to grade students' marks based on their scores. The maximum score is 100, while the minimum is 0, and that's why the score written on the script is between 0 and 100.  Students are therefore graded according to their score. The grading is such that students who score;
    79 and above  are graded "A.
    60 and above are graded as "B"
    49 and above are graded as "C"
    40 and above are graded as "D"
    Those below 40 are graded as "E"
    
part2: SpeedDetector
This code  is written on the basis that it takes the speed of a car as an input and sets a speed limit  of 70 or else for every 5km/hour above the speed limit, demerit points are given to the driver. the points get more than 12 points, the licence gets suspended. If the speed is less than or equal to the speed limit, then the output is "Ok"

part3: Net Salary Calculator
This program is used to calculate  an individual's net salary by getting inputs of basic salary and benefits.
They also include calculations such as payee, NHIFDeductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary and net salary
